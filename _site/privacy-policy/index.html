    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is critically important to me.</p>
    <p>Below is my privacy policy. (Note: I’ve decided to make this privacy
      policy available under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license, which means
      you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use.
      Just make sure to replace references to me with ones to you, and we’d
      appreciate a link to Bensanders.me somewhere on your site. We spent a lot
      of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same.)
    </p>

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>

    <p>Like most website operators, I collect non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
      available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
      and the date and time of each visitor request. my purpose in collecting
      non-personally identifying information is to better understand how my
      visitors use my website. From time to time, I may release
      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of my website.
    </p>
    <p>I also collect potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
      comments on BenSanders.me. I only disclose logged in user and commenter IP
      addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
      personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog
      commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to
      the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
      computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
      the visitor returns. I use cookies to help me identify and track visitors,
      their usage of my website, and their website access preferences. My visitors
      who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
      browsers to refuse cookies before using my websites, with the drawback that
      certain features of my website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Adsense &amp; Google Analytics</h2>

    <p>Ads appearing on my website may be delivered to users by advertising partners,
      who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer
      each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about
      you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to,
      among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
      be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies
      by me and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on
        a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve
        ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.

    <h2>Comments</h2>

    <p>Comments and other content submitted to our Disqus service are not saved on my servers.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change my Privacy Policy
      from time to time, and at my sole discretion. I encourage visitors to frequently
      check this page for any changes to my Privacy Policy. Your continued use of
      this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
