    Since I graduated back in 2011 I suppose I was one of the last group of high-schoolers
    to know what life was like before the proliferation of social media. One thing you
    have to keep in mind when sharing on the internet, let alone social media, is that
    once you put it out there. You have to assume it will always be there even if you 'delete' it.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, at one point when I was going to school for web design and development,
    I was looking into building a social network. Granted it was mostly to practice coding
    but I was still interested in building one. I did some research on how other social
    media websites handled things like 'deleting' images and posts. One thing I found out
    was that it doesn't actually 'delete' it just sort of hides it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm sure that it eventually does get deleted and is gone but by the time you
    hit the delete button. You never know who has downloaded it and possibly shared
    it somewhere else. Which is the point of this article is to say that if you want to
    share something think it through first.
  </p>
  <p>
    To tie up this article with a nice bow, I will say that the whole Facebook/Cambridge
    Analytica thing made me want to write this article. From a programmer/web developer
    perspective, I see the issue being caused both by Facebook and the users being careless.
    The users that got their information leaked because they used Facebook to login to random
    apps for quizzes. Facebook for not doing more to protect that data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moral of the story is just be more careful what you share online. If you do
    share more personal information online don't use Facebook to login to those
    personality quizzes.

    Thanks for reading and stay safe out there. :)
