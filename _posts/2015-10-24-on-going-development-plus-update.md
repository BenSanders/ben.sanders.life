I have talked before about my site being in development and like many sites, Facebook included, my site is in constant development. While I am trying to figure out what to blog here on my personal blog whether it be app reviews, game reviews, or just things going on in my life. I am also going to be putting out small updates to my site to make it better now that I feel like I understand the Wordpress back-end a little better.

I was thinking that if I blogged about technology or stuff I care about that maybe I can give my opinion and make some kind of a difference in the world. I will also put up vlogs and whatever other videos I make for YouTube on my site as I have designed this current design to better fit videos.

Anyway that's about it for this short update.
Thank you for reading. :)
