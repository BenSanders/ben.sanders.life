  <p class="introduction">
    I can remember the very first book I read all the way through. It was "Harry
    Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone".  I remember the day I decided to start
    reading the Harry Potter Series. It was right after I had seen the first film.
    I guess I wanted to be immersed in the Harry Potter universe even more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ever since those days though I haven't really read a whole lot other than
    the occasional blog posts. Which, I suppose, is still reading and you can
    still get the same benefits as reading a book. I just haven't taken the time
    to just sit back, relax, and take a journey with a nice book in a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    You see since the start of 2018 I have been thinking about reading more.
    Well, not just reading more but writing more as well. I am aware that I wrote
    several posts in 2017. I just want to try to write much longer, more meaningful
    blog posts. Sort of like short stories but on the web. Carefully crafting a
    story that would take the reader on an adventure with each and every word.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to try to take my writing to the next level by taking the reader on a
    journey in their own mind. Sort of the way a good book does when you sit down
    to read it. Like how you start imagining what that world would be like to
    live in.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm going to stray a little here to say that I have been trying to find my
    niche on YouTube. I had recently found the BookTube community which seems to
    go with what I want to do in terms of reading and writing more. Hell, I might
    even actually write a novel one day. Wouldn't that be great?
  </p>
  <p>
    So, where is this all going, I hear you ask yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, here in 2018 I would honestly like to read more. Starting with Emma
    Blackery's "Feel Good 101". I don't like setting a certain number but I'm
    going to say I'd like to read 20 books in 2018. Mostly books I already own
    which include: Egghead and The Fault in Our Stars.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Read Though?</h2>
  <p>
    Some people might say something about how you can get the same relaxation
    from watching TV or a YouTube video. The problem with that thinking though
    is that it still requires you to stare at a screen. I love the idea that
    reading allows you to put away your computer and phone for a small, to large,
    amount of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    While you can read on, say an iPad, you've still got the notifications
    coming through interrupting your reading. I want to read because it's a way
    to fully escape the world into a whole different one. Even reading non-fiction
    books can help you escape. It can conjure up what it must have been like to live
    in the times that book is talking about.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like the way that Paul Stamatiou worded it on his
    <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/reading-more-kindle-oasis/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Reading forces you to go one step further and not even let your mind wander
    a bit. If it does, you're punished by having to read the paragraph or page
    over again to understand whatâ€™s happening"
  </p>
  <p>
    That's very true I can attest to have been reading a book and my mind started
    wondering about something else. Then next thing I knew I was lost and didn't
    know where I had left off.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reading isn't just about relaxing though it also allows you to see things
    from a different perspective. If you are set in your beliefs on one thing
    reading can give you a new perspective on those beliefs. You may or may not
    change what you personally believe but at least you have a better understanding
    of someone else's point-of-view.
  </p>
  <h2>What to read?</h2>
  <p>
    As I've mentioned above I'm starting out with Emma Blackery's book since
    that is the most recent book I bought. I do have several books in mind that
    I have been meaning to read myself. One book is "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson.
    I will also be keeping an eye on Bill Gate's, <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/"
    target="_blank">Gatesnotes</a>, blog for ideas on
    books to read.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully, as mentioned previously, I found the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=booktube">BookTube community</a> which
    led me to make a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76373017-ben-sanders">Goodreads account</a>.
    So, that's another place I'm sure I'll find great books to read. Really,
    there should be no excuse for me not to read 20 books in 2018.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    My final thoughts are that I'm hoping I can actually read 20, or more, books
    in 2018. I'm sure it will lead to me having a greater knowledge of the world
    and ultimately help improve my writing. Who knows? Perhaps by November of this
    year, I will actually participate in NaNoWriMo and have a published novel. :)
