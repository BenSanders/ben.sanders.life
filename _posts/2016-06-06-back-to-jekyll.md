I change my mind a lot!

There I said it but no in all seriousness though I decided, after much thought,
to switch back over to Jekyll. The reason being that I felt that Wordpress,
while a very good platform for bloggers/writers, wasn't for me anymore. I wanted
to get back to my roots as a web developer and actually blog with code. I mean
using command line, git, and the like to power my blog. Plus I like the security
of not having to log into my site via a web based login. Now the only login I
have is that of my server.

There is just something serene of about running commands through a Powershell
window and uploading everything to a repo. I can also choose how I want the site
to look without any of the Wordpress code getting the way it just takes me back
to a time of writing some code and uploading it to a server.
