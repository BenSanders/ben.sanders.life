  It has come to my attention that I should move into the new age so to speak of
  web development. I managed to teach myself SASS and get better with GIT, ha get,
  all jokes aside I need to keep my skills up. So, over the next few days, weeks
  and even months I'll be implementing <a target="_blank" href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> into my site.
</p>
<p>
  I've always had trouble with things like the Hamburger menu, I guess because I
  always tried using an image for it. You know instead of using a CSS Icon Set.
  I'll also be trying to blog the experience more so I can get some actual
  content on this site.

</p>
<p>
  I've already started filling out my <a target="_blank" href="https://bensanders.me/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
  Although it's mostly just
  designs that I made up in Photoshop. I've also popped open Illustrator to make
  some logos but I don't feel they are that great to share yet. I mostly just
  keep trying to slog away to keep busy on something creative.

</p>
<p>
  I do still run my <i class="fa fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i> <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/thebensanders">YouTube</a>
  channel as well where I upload vlogs and short
  Overwatch clips. I have already uploaded more videos this year than all of
  last year put together and depending on if the Dragon Con trip works out I'll
  have that on my channel. Along with plenty of photos from the Con on this site.

</p>
<p>
  Whatever happens, the next 5 and a half months thank you for taking the time
  to read this little update post. That all it seems I ever do on this site
  anymore. (lol)

</p>
<p>
  Until Next Time, peace!<br />
