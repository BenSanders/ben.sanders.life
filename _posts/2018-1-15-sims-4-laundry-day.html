    So, it's finally here or at least tomorrow it will finally be here. The Sims
    4 Laundry Day stuff pack. Perhaps the first stuff pack I can remember I have
    been excited about. I think the main reason I'm excited about this stuff pack
    is that it is the first time the community has voted on what the next stuff
    pack will be. Maybe if this pack ends up being a success it will lead them to
    work with the community in future TS4 content.

    I'm a simmer, that's one thing that is for sure. I've been playing The Sims
    franchise since my dad bought the first game for my mom. I can remember
    spending hours as a kid playing the game. It's one of the main game franchises
    that shaped my childhood. Perhaps I'll do a video or a blog post on games I
    played as a child in the future.

  <p>
    So, what are my thoughts on the actual stuff pack getting ready to come out?
  </p>
  <p>
    I love it! The reason being that back when laundry was first introduced back
    in The Sims 3: Ambitions I loved watching my Sims do laundry. There's just
    something about laundry, and seasons, that adds more realism to the game.
    It makes it easier for me to put myself in that world.
  </p>

    There's also the trailer they made for the stuff pack which I can tell The
    Sims team was having fun. Although considering the topic of the stuff pack.
    I'm surprised they were able to make the trailer as exciting as it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm looking forward to putting another 300 hours into the game or, you know,
    something like that. I'll emerge on the other side not knowing what's going
    on in the real world. Perhaps even mainly speaking in Similish.
