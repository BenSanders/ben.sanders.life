Every 4 years we here in America get to decide who we want to represent us as a nation and every 4 years there's always a group of people who is disgusted and a group who is delighted. I will preface this by saying whoever is elected I will gladly call my president even if they are not the man or the woman I voted for because that is what America is all about. I will, however, say that this is the election that we as the American people have the greatest chance to change how our politics are played out. We for the first time in decades can actually work more towards a 3 or more party system and buck the establishment.

On the one hand, we have a guy like Donald J. Trump who is bent on showing that he is always right no matter what. He will flat out lie even when faced with the truth. On the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton who literally wants a war with Russia by controlling air space in Syria. There is another option in Gary Johnson who, while may not 100% perfect, but he at least understands that the country needs people to live with their own decisions. He has shown that he knows how to govern by leaving his state of New Mexico with a surplus and using his governor veto power to it's fullest. Also since he's not part of the two major parties and takes money from the people voting for him he's actually beholden to the people.

So to answer the question in case it wasn't already answered I will be voting for Gary Johnson because I agree more with the fiscally conservative side of him. The personal responsibility that he believes in.

Now that you've read my thoughts or more of a rant what are your thoughts or if I may who will you be supporting and why?
