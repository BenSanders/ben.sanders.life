  <p class="introduction">
    Since I started uploading more frequently to YouTube I have come across more
    people asking for sub4sub. The main problem with sub4sub is that, yes it gets
    you tons of subs, but you don't get actual views and watch time. You also end
    up with a bunch of subscriptions that you will probably never watch yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to getting people to subscribe to your channel you should want
    them to subscribe because you offer some kind of value to them. That value can
    come in the form of entertainment, education, or whatever else you might offer.
    That's why you should be doing a call-to-action at the end of your videos inviting
    viewers to subscribe, like, and/or comment. Doing that kind of reminds people that
    they can do all those things on YouTube.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may seem to take a lot longer to grow a channel without sub4sub but if you
    don't take part in that sub4sub culture. You will be able to find your niche on
    YouTube that will allow you to grow your channel. That just simply doesn't happen
    with sub4sub because it just gets a bunch of people subscribed that will probably
    only last at most a month.

    More recently I posted a link to my channel in a blogs comment section which
    got about 8 subs from. The problem was people commented saying "subbed, now sub back".
    Well as you can imagine once I didn't sub back all 8 unsubbed. That shows that they
    weren't actually interested in my content they just wanted to inflate their own sub count.

    All-in-all sub4sub is a pretty terrible way to grow a channel and I'll leave
    you with a video on the topic. That being said if you want to watch my content
    and subscribe to me because of that you can find my channel here. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/thebensanders/">https://youtube.com/thebensanders/</a>.
