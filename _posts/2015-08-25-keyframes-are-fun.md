Keyframes in HTML5 is fun. Well, I mean, coding is fun in general especially once you can get into "the zone" but the idea of making your website come alive is fun.

{% highlight css %}
Key Frames

@keyframes fadein {
from { opacity: 0; }
to { opacity: 1; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

I mean all I have to do is insert something like the above into my style.css document and it will make the class or id fade in on-load.
Anyway that is just a quick update to what I've been doing with this site lately - I'll keep you all posted as I design the site some more.
