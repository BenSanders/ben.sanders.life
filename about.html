      Hi, I’m Ben

      I’m a web developer living in Georgia an associate’s degree in web design and development.

      I love technology whether it is from Microsoft, Apple or where ever. I am a YouTuber trying to find his voice. I hope to one day start a tech startup to solve some problem that humanity has and maybe use YouTube as a launch pad for it.

      I don’t blog here very often but I’m hoping to change that in 2017. Some of the things I plan to blog about are some of the same things I plan on vlogging about. I plan on making product reviews of new tech that comes out and maybe a few gameplay videos thrown in the mix.

      If you’d like to keep quicker contact with me just follow my twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/thebensanders" target="_blank">@TheBenSanders</a>.

      In February of 2015 I experimated with Jekyll for the first time and made a template. But back then I didn’t fully grasp the power of Jekyll and was just learning. You can check out an old post from WayBack Machine here.
